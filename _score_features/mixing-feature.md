# Mixing busses
Intervals can become mixing busses for all their child process.

To use that feature, mark an interval as a bus in its inspector.
The Audio panel then allows to change its volume / pan.
Things with more than 2 channels will be available once we figure a proper UI for it - designers welcome as the code already supports it !
