*Score* let you remotely control any OSC (Open Sound Control) compatible device (be it hardware or software). To do so, we first need to setup our OSC device in *score*.

# Setting up communication with OSC device

Once opened a new *score* project, right-click in the Device explorer on the left of *score* window and choose 'Add device' from the Device explorer contextual menu. This brings *score*'s device setup window.

From the Protocols column, choose 'OSC' and setup IP address your device is running on as well in & out ports. You may also specify a name for your device. For the demo purpose here, we will use the default 'OSCdevice' name. When done, the Device explorer pane should display our device top node.

Note: Should you need to change settings of your OSC device, the setup panel can be brought back by choosing 'Edit' in the device contextual menu.

We can then setup our device's OSC addresses we want to automate within *score*.

# Setting up OSC addresses
## Using OSC learn

In the Device explorer pane, choose 'Learn' in our device contextual menu. This opens up *score*'s OSC learning window. *score* will now monitor any OSC incoming value.

For demo purpose here, we will use Vidvox's handy [OSC Test application](https://vdmx.vidvox.net/blog/freebies "Vidvox OSC Test app"). As soon as we send values to *score* from our OSC Test application, addresses get learned and displayed in the 'OSC learning' window.

When done, the Device explorer pane should display all learned OSC addresses. You can browse your device namespace, fold/unfold any node in the namespace hierarchy by clicking the arrow prepending each node. You can also see a parameter current value in your OSC device yb selecting this parameter in *score* Device explorer and check its bottom section.

## Adding addresses manually

Should you need to setup your *score* project without having your OSC device opened, addresses can be added in the device explorer manually.

Once having created an OSC device as explained above, choose 'Add child' in the device contextual menu.

As of *score* 3.0.0, each level of your parameter's OSC address is to be declared separately. Assuming we want to add the address 'OSCdevice/track/1/volume', we first need to create the 'track' node. From the OSC editor window, type 'track' in the 'Name' text field and leave default type 'container' (that is: a node in the namespace above other nodes or parameters). Then from the freshly created 'track' node contextual menu, choose 'Add child' to create a '1' node, then from this node, choose 'Add child' again to create our 'volume' parameter.

For our 'volume' parameter, we want to set the type as something else than 'container'. For example, we will set up our parameter as a float value.

You may also edits some of the parameter's attributes as detailed in next step.

# Setting up parameters' attributes

Once declared either using learn function or manually, parameter's general behaviour can be further defined by setting up its various attributes.

When selecting a parameter in the Device explorer pane, its attributes can be displayed and edited in the bottom section of the pane. A dedicated window can also be opened by choose 'Edit' in the parameter contextual menu.

For each value type, a number of attributes can be defined, such as: value domain (min. and max. value), clip mode (parameter handling of value exceeding its domain), repetition filter,etc.

# Saving OSC device for later use

When properly set up, your OSC device namespace can be exported and saved to disk for latter use. To do so, choose "Export device" in the device contaxtual menu.
