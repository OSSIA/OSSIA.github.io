- It is possible to choose the desired behaviour for off-time triggers : either triggering them stops and restarts the subgraph immediately, or it stops the subgraph and will only restart it after a new triggering. This choice is done in the trigger inspector.

# Keyboard shortcuts
Pressing suppr / backspace when a trigger is selected removes it.
