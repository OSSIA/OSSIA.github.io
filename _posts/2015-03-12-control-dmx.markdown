For now, i-score can send and receive only OSC or MIDI messages. But if you would like to use i-score to control lighting devices, there is a nice framework that can be used to translate OSC messages to Artnet, Sacn on a local network. Itâ€™s called OLA for Open Lighting Architecture.

Ola can handle a lot of lighting protocols such as described on this page. You can download a namespace for OLA here, and a conf file for OSC plugin of OLA here.
