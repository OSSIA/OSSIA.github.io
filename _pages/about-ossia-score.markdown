<h2>About ossia score</h2>

ossia score is based on more than 15 years of research at LaBRI in the frame of the i-score (interactive scores) project.

It currently uses the OSSIA library (libossia), which is a reimplementation of the Score engine for the execution engine, and of Jamoma Modular for the network/interoperability management.
Parts of this library have been made accessible through APIs to several programming languages and implementations in various creative environments
